import { useState, useEffect } from "react";

// The useEffect Hook
// We use useEffect when a render needs to cause side effects. Think of a side
// effect as somehting that a function does that it isn't part of the return

// Example: A network request

function Checkbox() {
  return (
	<section>

	</section>
	);
}

export default Checkbox;
